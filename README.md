# Mosbot::Cli

`mosbot` will generate a My Oracle Support URL based on a document ID, bug number, patch number or community idea.

## Installation

    $ gem install mosbot

## Usage

To use `mosbot`, enter the URL type and the number.

    $ mosbot doc 123456.1
    $ https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=123456.1

    $ mosbot bug 1222341
    $ https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/BugMatrix?id=1222341

`mosbot` will default to documents. If you specify only a number `mosbot` will return a document URL. Supported types are:

* `doc`
* `bug`
* `patch`
* `idea`

There are two parameters for `mosbot`

* `-c`: Copy the URL to your clipboard
* `-o`: Open the URL in your browser

You can also configure `mosbot` to copy the output URL or open a browser window with the URL. The environment variables `MOS_COPY_URL=true` and `MOS_OPEN_URL=true` control how `mosbot` handles the output.

`MOS_COPY_URL` and `MOS_OPEN_URL` options default to `false`.

## Config File

`mosbot` will also ready from a configuration file. The default config file is `~/.mosbot.conf`. You can override that file by using the `MOS_BOT_CONF` environment variable.

The `.mosbot.conf` file stores key=value pairs:

```ini
MOS_COPY_URL=true
MOS_OPEN_URL=true
```

The configuration file takes precedence over environment variables.
